\usepackage[role = cvprblue, grid = lightgrey, skipempty, horizontal]{credits}

% You may enter roles with continous values indicating partial
% contribution. The ordering of the values follows the ordering 
% of the original taxonomy, i.e.:
\credit{Doug}  {1,0.5,0,0,0.2,0.8,1,1,1,1,0.1,0,0.9,1}
\credit{Eve}    {0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1}
% Values between 0 and 1 will be scaled to be mixed with the background
% colour (white, unless changed by TikZ). This enables giving *partial*
% credit to authors (for instance, if someone helped out initially with
% data curation, but then later went on to another project).
\credit{Frank}{0,0.5,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0}
