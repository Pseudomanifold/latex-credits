% - Conceptualization
% - Data curation
% - Formal analysis
% - Funding acquisition
% - Investigation
% - Methodology
% - Project administration
% - Resources
% - Software
% - Supervision
% - Validation
% - Visualization

\credit{Bob}    {0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1}

% Values between 0 and 1 will be scaled to be mixed with the background
% colour (white, unless changed by TikZ). This enables giving *partial*
% credit to authors (for instance, if someone helped out initially with
% data curation, but then later went on to another project).
